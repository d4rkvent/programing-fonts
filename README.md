# Best Fonts For Programming

## Fonts

As developers, we spend the majority of our day in front of a computer screen writing code. I'm going to share the best fonts you can use specifically for coding. While subjective, I've comprised the list of free and paid fonts that make legibility a high priority (bonus points for the font looking beautiful as well).
